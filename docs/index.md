The EOS Documentation Portal hosts a rich array of technical product documentation resources created and curated for the EOS blockchain developers community. These resources empower developers from all technology backgrounds to build enterprise-grade, secure, and scalable blockchain applications using the open-source EOS software.

## EOS Blockchain Roles

This portal supports your EOS learning and development journey from the lens of the roles below. Select the appropriate EOS blockchain role based on your needs:

- [**Smart Contracts**](./20_smart-contracts/index.md): Learn how to develop, deploy, and use smart contracts for the EOS blockchain.
- [**Web Applications**](./30_web-applications/index.md): Learn how to design and implement web applications for the EOS blockchain.
- [**Node Operation**](./40_node-operation/index.md): Learn how to configure and deploy Leap nodes for the EOS blockchain.


## What is a blockchain?

A blockchain is a type of software that is decentralized and not controlled by any one entity. It is characterized by being immutable, traceable, and transparent. Transactions recorded on the blockchain are permanently stored and any changes can be traced and audited, making the history of the blockchain transparent.

## What is EOS?

The EOS blockchain is a next-generation, open-source blockchain with industry-leading transaction speed and flexible utility. The EOS blockchain is public, designed for enterprise-grade use cases and customizable to suit a wide range of business needs across industries with role-based permissions system and secure application transactions processing.

Building distributed applications on EOS follows familiar development patterns and programming languages used for developing non-blockchain applications. For application developers, familiarity with the development environment results in a seamless user experience as it allows developers to use their preferred development tools.

The EOS blockchain provides functionalities such as accounts, authentication, databases, asynchronous communication, and the scheduling of applications across multiple CPU cores and clusters. These functionalities are also common in non-blockchain software development environments.
