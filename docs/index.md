## What is EOS

The EOS blockchain is the next-generation, open-source blockchain with industry-leading transaction speed and a flexible utility. The EOS blockchain is public, designed for enterprise-grade use cases and customizable to suit a wide range of business needs across industries with role-based permissions system and secure application transactions processing.

Building distributed applications on EOS follows familiar development patterns and programming languages used for developing non-blockchain applications. For application developers, familiarity with the development environment results in a seamless user experience as it allows developers to use their preferred development tools.

The EOS blockchain provides functionalities such as accounts, authentication, databases, asynchronous communication, and the scheduling of applications across multiple CPU cores and clusters. These functionalities are also common in non-blockchain software development environments.

## About Blockchain

A blockchain is a decentralized infrastructure software without a centralized entity controlling the blockchain. Blockchains are defined in many ways but they all share the common attributes of being decentralized, immutable, traceable, and transparent.

The transactions recorded on the blockchain form an immutable history of the blockchain. Any transaction or change in the blockchain history is traceable and can be audited, thus, making the blockchain history transparent.
