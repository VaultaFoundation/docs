## Welcome to the Antelope Developer Portal!

The *Antelope Developer Portal* is an Antelope documentation framework that hosts a rich array of technical product documentation resources created and curated for the Antelope blockchain developers community. These resources empower developers from all technology backgrounds to build enterprise-grade, secure, and scalable blockchain applications using the open-source Antelope software.

We recognize our community developers to be an important part of the Antelope blockchain ecosystem. Using the open source development model, we have a shared mission of leveraging the power of open source technologies to further mature the Antelope framework.

> *The advancement of blockchain is the result of passionate developers like you building platforms that will inject trust and security back into our institutional systems*

Are you a new entrant to the blockchain space? If yes, no worries, we have learning and onboarding content to help orient you to the Antelope development environment and create your first basic smart contract. If you are a seasoned blockchain developer enthusiast, we offer you a variety of documentation assets from advanced development tutorials to API reference guides.

This portal supports your Antelope learning and development journey through the following curated technical documentation resources:

* [**Antelope Concepts**](../20_introduction-to-eosio): Learn the core concepts of the Antelope framework
* [**Antelope Protocols**](../60_protocol-guides): Gain a deeper understanding of the various protocols such as [Accounts and Permissions](../60_protocol-guides/40_accounts_and_permissions.md) implemented in the Antelope framework
* [**Antelope Getting Started**](../30_getting-started-guide): Orient yourself with the Antelope development environment and basic smart contract development. Best suited for new developers onboarding the Antelope blockchain ecosystem
* **API and SDK Reference**: Browse our API catalogue and discover what kinds of APIs we provide
Glossary: Browse through a curated list of Antelope terminologies.

And more!

## Antelope Docs is Open Source

The *Antelope Developer Portal* generates documentation from source files hosted on Github, alongside the [EOSIO](https://github.com/EOSIO) codebase. All documentation assets on [*docs.eosnetwork.com*](https://docs.eosnetwork.com/) is open sourced and designed to allow community contributions. We leverage the power of open source to deliver trusted content to support your Antelope onboarding and advanced development journey.

### A Bit of History

The Developer Relations team (responsible for authoring the Antelope developer documentation) spearheaded an audacious endeavor on the Antelope product documentation spectrum. Due to the inherently intricate nature of the Antelope software framework, the Developer Relations team collaborates closely with the Antelope engineering division to receive authoritative, firsthand knowledge and inputs from the creators of the framework. The Developer Relations team conducted a sweeping tech reconnaissance of the then docs-engineering collaboration framework and ideated an environment to foster productive collaboration with the internal engineering division and the external Antelope developer community. We discarded the then-existing, proprietary CMS framework, and implemented a new developer docs toolchain, where you produce documentation in the same ecosystem as code, in close proximity with the developers - [*Docs-as-Code*](https://www.docslikecode.com/).

The Developer Relations team further executed a conscientious and concerted effort of designing and deploying the Developer Portal that generates developer documentation by parsing source files in GitHub. The result of this effort was a developer portal that allows internal and external community contributions to the documentation.

### Fun Fact

Heard about the [*Github Archive Program*](https://archiveprogram.github.com/)? The endeavor to preserve open source software for future generations in case of an extinction-level event? 

The *Github Archive Program* includes the [Antelope Project](https://github.com/EOSIO) (which includes documentation commits) along with other open source projects like Linux, Android, nodeJS, GatsbyJS, Python, docker, Bitcoin, Postgres, and others. Therefore, the longevity of the Antelope source code is guaranteed!
