While there are a few steps to installing and configuring a local node, it is pretty straight forward once you understand the pieces. This guide will walk you through configuring Ubuntu (or other Debian based Linux distributions), installing [Antelope Leap](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap), [Contract Development Toolkit (CDT)](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/cdt), and the [EOS Foundation Network's System Contracts](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/eos-system-contracts), then configuriong everything for a local developmance instance. The process itself only takes a few minutes, but we will explain the parts as we progress through them and point you to additional resources for other options.
