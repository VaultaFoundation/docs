title: BIOS Boot Sequence Tutorial
---

## Overview

In this tutorial, you will learn how to boostrap a new EOS blockchain and get familiar with the steps involved in its deployment. You will start your boot node, load the system contracts, and then add multiple block producers to extend your single node blockchain into a multi node network. Finally, you will perform some node operator tasks on your new blockchain.

## Audience
This tutorial is useful for any node operator or blockchain developer who wants to understand how a multi node blockchain can be set up and launched. Although a typical blockchain will consist of multiple remote nodes, the commands to set up each node are to be performed in a similar fashion at each remote location.

[[note | Note]]
| _The steps here can be readily expanded for the networked case. Some assumptions are made here regarding how the parties involved will coordinate with each other. However, there are many ways that the community can choose to coordinate. The technical aspects of the process are objective; assumptions of how the coordination might occur are speculative. Several approaches have already been suggested by the community. You are encouraged to review the various approaches and get involved in the discussions as appropriate._

### Objectives
In this tutorial, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:
* Install and build the reference system contracts.
* Deploy a multi node blockchain with various nodes.
* Create user accounts on the multi node blockchain.
* Allocate a new SYS currency token in the blockchain.
* Call an action to transfer SYS tokens among user accounts.
* Transition from a single node producer to multiple node producers.

## Prerequisites
Before you start this tutorial, get familiar with the following sections:

### Overview
* [Framework and Toolchain](https://docs.eosnetwork.com/docs/latest/overview/framework_and_toolchain)
* [Core Concepts](https://docs.eosnetwork.com/docs/latest/overview/core_concepts)
* [Technical Features](https://docs.eosnetwork.com/docs/latest/overview/technical_features)

Also, make sure to learn about the software prerequisites, and install the required software before you continue this tutorial:

### Development Environment
* [Software Prerequisites](http://docs.eosnetwork.com/docs/latest/getting-started/development-environment/prerequisites)
* [Before You Begin](http://docs.eosnetwork.com/docs/latest/getting-started/development-environment/before-you-begin)

## Workflow

The BIOS Boot sequence undergoes two significant workflows:

1. [Create, Configure and Start the Genesis Node](#1-create-configure-and-start-the-genesis-node)
2. [Transition from single genesis producer to multiple producers](#2-transition-from-single-genesis-producer-to-multiple-producers)

## 1. Create, Configure and Start the Genesis Node

The information in this section walk you through the preparatory steps for the following:

* Set up your Leap environment
* Start your genesis Leap node
* Set up additional, interconnected Leap nodes with connectivity to the genesis node

At the end of the tutorial, you will have a fully functional **EOS blockchain** which runs locally.

[[info | Python Script]]
| Alternatively, if you would like to automate these steps, you can use the [bios-boot-tutorial.py](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap//blob/main/tutorials/bios-boot-tutorial/bios-boot-tutorial.py) python script that implements the preparatory steps. However, the script uses different and additional data values. See the file `accounts.json` for the producer names and the user account names that the script uses. If your goal is to build a fully functional EOS blockchain on your local machine by automation, you can run the `bios-boot-tutorial.py` script directly by following the [README.md](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap//blob/main/tutorials/bios-boot-tutorial/README.md) instructions.

If your goal is to go beyond and understand what the script does in depth, you can follow this tutorial which will get you through the outcome and also explains each step along the way.

### 1.1. Install the Binaries

#### 1.1.1. Pre-compiled EOS Binaries

For instructions to install the `nodeos` binaries, follow the [Development Environment](#development-environment) instructions in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section, but do not start `nodeos` at this stage.

#### 1.1.2. CDT Binaries

For instructions to install the CDT binaries, follow the [Development Environment](#development-environment) instructions in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

### 1.2. Create a Development Wallet

Create and configure your default wallet, followed by creating a public and private development keys. After the key-pair is created, import the public and private key to your wallet. For reference purposes, we will refer to the public key as `EOS_PUB_DEV_KEY` and the private key as `EOS_PRIV_DEV_KEY`.

For instructions on creating a wallet and importing keys securely into it, see the [Create a development wallet](/docs/40_node-operation/10_getting-started/10_local-development-setup/05_create-development-wallet.md) section.

### 1.3. Create ~/biosboot/genesis directory

Create a new directory `~/biosboot/genesis`. Later on, you will start the genesis node by executing `nodeos` with specific parameters that will create the blockchain database, the log file, and the configuration file inside this directory.

```shell
cd ~
mkdir biosboot
cd biosboot
mkdir genesis
cd genesis
```

### 1.4. Create a JSON file in ~/biosboot directory

1. Create an empty `genesis.json` file in the `~/biosboot/` directory and open it in your preferred text editor (demonstrated with nano editor here):

```shell
cd ~/biosboot
touch genesis.json
nano genesis.json
```

2. Copy the following JSON content to clipboard:

```json
{
  "initial_timestamp": "2018-12-05T08:55:11.000",
  "initial_key": "EOS_PUB_DEV_KEY",
  "initial_configuration": {
    "max_block_net_usage": 1048576,
    "target_block_net_usage_pct": 1000,
    "max_transaction_net_usage": 524288,
    "base_per_transaction_net_usage": 12,
    "net_usage_leeway": 500,
    "context_free_discount_net_usage_num": 20,
    "context_free_discount_net_usage_den": 100,
    "max_block_cpu_usage": 200000,
    "target_block_cpu_usage_pct": 1000,
    "max_transaction_cpu_usage": 150000,
    "min_transaction_cpu_usage": 100,
    "max_transaction_lifetime": 3600,
    "deferred_trx_expiration_window": 600,
    "max_transaction_delay": 3888000,
    "max_inline_action_size": 524288,
    "max_inline_action_depth": 4,
    "max_authority_depth": 6
  },
  "initial_chain_id": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
}
```

3. Paste the JSON content into the `genesis.json` file.
Replace the `EOS_PUB_DEV_KEY` with the public key you created in  [1.2. Create a Development Wallet](#12-create-a-development-wallet).

4. Save and exit the text editor:

```shell
[CTRL]+X
y
[ENTER]
```

### 1.5. Start, stop, and restart the Genesis node

In this section you will create scripts to start, stop, and restart the genesis node. Then, you will execute the scripts in that order, which will keep the genesis node running.

#### 1.5.1. Start the Genesis node

To start the genesis node follow the steps below:

1. Create a `genesis_start.sh` shell script file in the `~/biosboot/genesis/` directory and open the file with your preferred editor (demonstrated with nano editor here):

```shell
cd ~/biosboot/genesis
touch genesis_start.sh
nano genesis_start.sh
```

2. Copy the following shell script content and paste it to the `genesis_start.sh` shell script file:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
DATADIR="./blockchain"

if [ ! -d $DATADIR ]; then
  mkdir -p $DATADIR;
fi

nodeos \
--genesis-json $DATADIR"/../../genesis.json" \
--signature-provider EOS_PUB_DEV_KEY=KEY:EOS_PRIV_DEV_KEY \
--plugin eosio::producer_plugin \
--plugin eosio::producer_api_plugin \
--plugin eosio::chain_plugin \
--plugin eosio::chain_api_plugin \
--plugin eosio::http_plugin \
--plugin eosio::history_api_plugin \
--plugin eosio::history_plugin \
--data-dir $DATADIR"/data" \
--blocks-dir $DATADIR"/blocks" \
--config-dir $DATADIR"/config" \
--producer-name eosio \
--http-server-address 127.0.0.1:8888 \
--p2p-listen-endpoint 127.0.0.1:9010 \
--access-control-allow-origin=* \
--contracts-console \
--http-validate-host=false \
--verbose-http-errors \
--enable-stale-production \
--p2p-peer-address localhost:9011 \
--p2p-peer-address localhost:9012 \
--p2p-peer-address localhost:9013 \
>> $DATADIR"/nodeos.log" 2>&1 & \
echo $! > $DATADIR"/eosd.pid"
```

[[info | Important]]
| Replace the `EOS_PUB_DEV_KEY` and `EOS_PRIV_DEV_KEY` with the public and private key values you generated in step [1.2. Create a Development Wallet](#12-create-a-development-wallet).

3. Save and exit the text editor:

```shell
[CTRL]+X
y
[ENTER]
```

4. Assign execution privileges to the `genesis_start.sh` shell script file, then execute the `genesis_start.sh` script to start the genesis node:

```shell
cd ~/biosboot/genesis/
chmod 755 genesis_start.sh
./genesis_start.sh
```

[[info | The genesis node is defined by the following:]]
| - Bears the name `eosio`
| - Produces blocks
| - Listens for HTTP request on 127.0.0.1:8888
| - Listens for peer connections requests on 127.0.0.1:9010
| - Initiates periodic peer connections to localhost:9011, localhost:9012, and localhost:9013; these nodes do not run yet so ignore if you see any failed connection attempts
| - Has the parameter `--contracts-console` which prints contracts output to the console; in our case, this information is good for troubleshooting problems

#### 1.5.2. Stop the Genesis node

To stop the genesis node follow the steps below:

1. Create a `stop.sh` shell script file in the `~/biosboot/genesis/` directory and copy the following `stop.sh` script to it:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
DATADIR="./blockchain/"

if [ -f $DATADIR"/eosd.pid" ]; then
pid=`cat $DATADIR"/eosd.pid"`
echo $pid
kill $pid
rm -r $DATADIR"/eosd.pid"
echo -ne "Stoping Node"
while true; do
[ ! -d "/proc/$pid/fd" ] && break
echo -ne "."
sleep 1
done
echo -ne "\rNode Stopped. \n"
fi
```

2. Execute the `stop.sh` shell script from the same `~/biosboot/genesis/` directory:

```shell
cd ~/biosboot/genesis/
chmod 755 stop.sh
./stop.sh
```

#### 1.5.3. Restart the Genesis node

After stopping the `nodeos` process, you will not be able to restart it using the  `.genesis_start.sh` script created in [1.5.1. Start the Genesis node](#151-start-the-genesis-node) since once a node runs and produces blocks, the blockchain database initializes and gets populated. Thus, `nodeos` will be unable to restart with the `--genesis-json` parameter. Therefore, it is recommended to create a new script `start.sh` and copy the content belows to it. Also, assign execution privileges to the script and use this file for any future `nodeos` restarts after the process has stopped.

```shell
#!/bin/bash
DATADIR="./blockchain"

if [ ! -d $DATADIR ]; then
  mkdir -p $DATADIR;
fi

nodeos \
--signature-provider EOS_PUB_DEV_KEY=KEY:EOS_PRIV_DEV_KEY \
--plugin eosio::producer_plugin \
--plugin eosio::producer_api_plugin \
--plugin eosio::chain_plugin \
--plugin eosio::chain_api_plugin \
--plugin eosio::http_plugin \
--plugin eosio::history_api_plugin \
--plugin eosio::history_plugin \
--data-dir $DATADIR"/data" \
--blocks-dir $DATADIR"/blocks" \
--config-dir $DATADIR"/config" \
--producer-name eosio \
--http-server-address 127.0.0.1:8888 \
--p2p-listen-endpoint 127.0.0.1:9010 \
--access-control-allow-origin=* \
--contracts-console \
--http-validate-host=false \
--verbose-http-errors \
--enable-stale-production \
--p2p-peer-address localhost:9011 \
--p2p-peer-address localhost:9012 \
--p2p-peer-address localhost:9013 \
>> $DATADIR"/nodeos.log" 2>&1 & \
echo $! > $DATADIR"/eosd.pid"
```

#### 1.5.4. Restart Genesis node with Replay

`"perhaps we need to replay"`: This error can occur when you restart `nodeos` due to a missing `--hard-replay` parameter which replays all the transactions from the genesis node. To overcome this error, add the parameter `--hard-replay` in the new `hard_replay.sh` shell script.

[[info | Some other parameters that you can use to restart nodeos are:]]
| - `--truncate-at-block`
| - `--delete-all-blocks`
| - `--replay-blockchain`
| - `--hard-replay-blockchain`

The following is the `hard_replay.sh` shell script which uses the `--hard-replay-blockchain` parameter:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
DATADIR="./blockchain"

if [ ! -d $DATADIR ]; then
  mkdir -p $DATADIR;
fi

nodeos \
--signature-provider EOS_PUB_DEV_KEY=KEY:EOS_PRIV_DEV_KEY \
--plugin eosio::producer_plugin \
--plugin eosio::producer_api_plugin \
--plugin eosio::chain_plugin \
--plugin eosio::chain_api_plugin \
--plugin eosio::http_plugin \
--plugin eosio::history_api_plugin \
--plugin eosio::history_plugin \
--data-dir $DATADIR"/data" \
--blocks-dir $DATADIR"/blocks" \
--config-dir $DATADIR"/config" \
--producer-name eosio \
--http-server-address 127.0.0.1:8888 \
--p2p-listen-endpoint 127.0.0.1:9010 \
--access-control-allow-origin=* \
--contracts-console \
--http-validate-host=false \
--verbose-http-errors \
--enable-stale-production \
--p2p-peer-address localhost:9011 \
--p2p-peer-address localhost:9012 \
--p2p-peer-address localhost:9013 \
--hard-replay-blockchain \
>> $DATADIR"/nodeos.log" 2>&1 & \
echo $! > $DATADIR"/eosd.pid"

```

#### 1.5.5. Restart Genesis node from Scratch

1. Copy the content below into the new script `clean.sh` and give execution permission to it:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
rm -fr blockchain
ls -al
```

2. If you want to start the genesis node from scratch, you need to erase the current configuration, the blockchain data, and logs, first by running the `stop.sh` script, followed the `clean.sh` script. Then you restart using the `genesis_start.sh` script:

```shell
cd ~/biosboot/genesis/
./stop.sh
./clean.sh
./genesis_start.sh
```

### 1.6. Inspect the nodeos.log file

Inspect the `nodeos.log` file with the following command, then press `[CTRL]+C` to exit the listing mode.

```shell
cd ~/biosboot/genesis/
tail -f ./blockchain/nodeos.log
```

### 1.7. Create system accounts
There are several system accounts that are needed, namely:

```text
  eosio.bpay
  eosio.msig
  eosio.names
  eosio.ram
  eosio.ramfee
  eosio.saving
  eosio.stake
  eosio.token
  eosio.vpay
  eosio.rex
```

Repeat the following steps to create an account for each of the system accounts.  In this tutorial, we will use the same key pair for both the account owner and active keys, so we only need to provide the key value once on the command line. For most general accounts, it is a good practice to use separate keys for owner and active. The script uses the same key for all of the `eosio.*` accounts. You can use different keys for each.

Type the following commands at the shell prompt:

[[note | Note]]
| _The output of each shell command is displayed immediately below, if applicable._

```shell
cleos create key --to-console
```
```console
Private key: 5KAVVPzPZnbAx8dHz6UWVPFDVFtU1P5ncUzwHGQFuTxnEbdHJL4
Public key: EOS84BLRbGbFahNJEpnnJHYCoW9QPbQEk2iHsHGGS6qcVUq9HhutG
```

Next, type the following at the shell:

```shell
cleos wallet import --private-key
```

Then paste the private key generated previously.

The output should be similar to:

```shell
imported private key for: EOS84BLRbGbFahNJEpnnJHYCoW9QPbQEk2iHsHGGS6qcVUq9HhutG
```

Now you can create the accounts and use the public key generated previously. The following command creates the account `eosio.bpay`. You should type similar commands to create all the other accounts listed previously:

```shell
cleos create account eosio eosio.bpay EOS84BLRbGbFahNJEpnnJHYCoW9QPbQEk2iHsHGGS6qcVUq9HhutG
```
```console
executed transaction: ca68bb3e931898cdd3c72d6efe373ce26e6845fc486b42bc5d185643ea7a90b1  200 bytes  280 us
#         eosio <= eosio::newaccount            {"creator":"eosio","name":"eosio.bpay","owner":{"threshold":1,"keys":[{"key":"EOS84BLRbGbFahNJEpnnJH...
```

### 1.8. Build the Reference System Contracts

System smart contracts provide the actions for all token-based operational behavior. Before the system contracts are deployed, actions are done independent of accounting operations. Once the system contracts are enabled, actions now have an economic element to them. System Resources (CPU, network, memory) must be paid for, and likewise, new accounts must be paid for. The system contracts enable tokens to be staked and unstaked, resources to be purchased, potential producers to be registered, and subsequently voted on, producer rewards to be claimed, privileges and limits to be set, and more.

To have a minimum functional EOS blockchain you need to install at least the following system contracts:

* `eosio.system`
* `eosio.msig`
* `eosio.token`
* `eosio.boot`

All of these contracts can be installed from the [reference-contracts](https://github.com/antelopeIO/reference-contracts/) repository.

#### 1.8.1. Build reference-contracts

To build the reference contracts, you need to clone the `reference-contracts` repository and follow the build instructions in its [README](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/reference-contracts) file. When building with `cmake`, make sure to define the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` and `BUILD_TESTS=OFF` flags. Also, print the current directory in the terminal and make a note of it. The current directory will be referred to as `EOSIO_CONTRACTS_DIRECTORY`. The commands should be similar too:

```shell
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/AntelopeIO/reference-contracts.git
cd ./reference-contracts/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF
make -j $(nproc)
cd ./contracts/
pwd
```

### 1.9. Deploy the `eosio.token` contract

Next, you have to deploy the `eosio.token` contract. This contract enables you to create, issue, transfer, and get information about tokens. To deploy the `eosio.token` contract:

```shell
cleos set contract eosio.token EOSIO_CONTRACTS_DIRECTORY/eosio.token/
```
```console
Reading WAST/WASM from /users/documents/eos/contracts/eosio.token/eosio.token.wasm...
Using already assembled WASM...

```

### 1.10. Deploy the `eosio.msig` contract

The `eosio.msig` contract enables and simplifies the definition and management of permission levels and the multi-signature process. To deploy the `eosio.msig` contract run the following command:

```shell
cleos set contract eosio.msig EOSIO_CONTRACTS_DIRECTORY/eosio.msig/
```
```console
Reading WAST/WASM from /users/documents/eos/build/contracts/eosio.msig/eosio.msig.wasm...

```

### 1.11. Create and allocate the SYS currency

Create the `SYS` currency with a maximum value of 10 billion tokens. Then, issue one billion tokens. Replace `SYS` with your specific currency designation, if you have a different one.

1. In the first step, the `create` action from the `eosio.token` contract, authorized by the `eosio.token` account, creates 1B `SYS` tokens in the `eosio` account. This effectively creates the maximum supply of tokens, but does not put any tokens into circulation. Tokens not in circulation can be considered to be held in reserve.

```shell
cleos push action eosio.token create '[ "eosio", "10000000000.0000 SYS" ]' -p eosio.token@active
```
```console
executed transaction: 0440461e0d8816b4a8fd9d47c1a6a53536d3c7af54abf53eace884f008429697  120 bytes  326 us
#   eosio.token <= eosio.token::create          {"issuer":"eosio","maximum_supply":"10000000000.0000 SYS"}
```

2. In the second step, the `eosio.token` contract's `issue` action takes 1B `SYS` tokens out of reserve and puts them into circulation. At the time of issue, the tokens are held within the `eosio` account. Since the `eosio` account owns the reserve of uncirculated tokens, its authority is required to do the action.

```shell
cleos push action eosio.token issue '[ "eosio", "1000000000.0000 SYS", "memo" ]' -p eosio@active
```
```console
executed transaction: a53961a566c1faa95531efb422cd952611b17d728edac833c9a55582425f98ed  128 bytes  432 us
#   eosio.token <= eosio.token::issue           {"to":"eosio","quantity":"1000000000.0000 SYS","memo":"memo"}
```

[[note | Note]]
| _As a point of interest, from an economic point of view, token movement from reserve into circulation, by issuing tokens, is an inflationary action. The tokens issuance is just one way for inflation to occur._

### 1.12. Deploy the system contracts

All new protocol upgrade features require a special protocol feature, codenamed `PREACTIVATE_FEATURE`, to be activated. It is also required for an updated version of the system contract that makes use of the functionality introduced by that feature to be deployed.

#### 1.12.1. Activate the `PREACTIVATE_FEATURE` protocol

To activate the special protocol `PREACTIVATE_FEATURE` launch the following command:

```shell
curl --request POST \
    --url http://127.0.0.1:8888/v1/producer/schedule_protocol_feature_activations \
    -d '{"protocol_features_to_activate": ["0ec7e080177b2c02b278d5088611686b49d739925a92d9bfcacd7fc6b74053bd"]}'
```

#### 1.12.2. Deploy the `eosio.boot` contract

The `eosio.boot` contract allows protocol features to be enabled on a new blockchain. These are highly recommended for any EOS blockchain.

To install the `eosio.boot` contract, run the following command:

```shell
cleos set contract eosio EOSIO_CONTRACTS_DIRECTORY/eosio.boot/
```
```console

```

#### 1.12.3. Enable Protocol Features

After you deploy the `eosio.boot` contract, run the following commands to enable the rest of the features:

[[info | Optional Step]]
| These features are optional. You can choose to enable or continue without these features. However, they are highly recommended for any EOS blockchain.

```shell

#### 1.12.4. Deploy `eosio.system` contract

Run the following command to deploy the `eosio.system` contract:

```shell
cleos set contract eosio EOSIO_CONTRACTS_DIRECTORY/eosio.system/
```

## 2. Transition from single genesis producer to multiple producers

In the next set of steps, we will transition from a single block producer (the genesis node) to multiple producers. Up to this point, only the built-in `eosio` account is privileged and can sign blocks. The target is to manage the blockchain by a collection of elected producers, operating under a rule of **2/3 + 1** producers agreeing before a block is final.

Producers are chosen by election. The list of producers can change. Rather than giving privileged authority directly to any producer, the governing rules are associated with a special built-in account named `eosio.prods`. This account represents the group of elected producers. The `eosio.prods` account (effectively the producer group) operates using permissions defined by the `eosio.msig` contract.

After the `eosio.system` contract is deployed, designate `eosio.msig` as a privileged account so it can authorize on behalf of the `eosio` account. Consequently, the `eosio` account will resign its authority and the `eosio.prods` account will take over.

### 2.1. Designate `eosio.msig` as privileged account

Run the following command to designate `eosio.msig` as a privileged account:

```shell
cleos push action eosio setpriv '["eosio.msig", 1]' -p eosio@active
```

### 2.2. Initialize system account

To initialize the `system` account with code zero (needed at initialization time) and `SYS` token with precision 4 (precision can range from 0 to 18), run the following:

```shell
cleos push action eosio init '["0", "4,SYS"]' -p eosio@active
```

### 2.3. Stake tokens and expand the network

If you have followed the tutorial up to this point, you now have a single-host, single-node configuration with the following contracts installed:

- eosio.token
- eosio.msig
- eosio.boot
- eosio.system

The accounts `eosio` and `eosio.msig` are privileged accounts. The other `eosio.*` accounts are created but they are not privileged.

You are now ready to stake and expand the network of producers.

### 2.4. Create staked accounts

Staking is the process by which you allocate and reserve tokens to an account on the EOS blockchain. Staking and unstaking are an on-going process throughout the life of a blockchain. The initial staking done during the bios boot process is special. During the bios boot sequence, accounts are staked with their tokens. However, until producers are elected, tokens are effectively in a frozen state. Thus, the goal of the initial staking done during the bios boot sequence is to get tokens allocated and distributed to the accounts so that the voting process can get started and producers can be elected for the blockchain to run "live".

The following recommendation is given for the initial staking process:

1. 0.1 token (literally, not 10% of the account's tokens) is staked for RAM.  By default, `cleos` stakes 8 KB of RAM on account creation, paid by the account creator. In the initial staking, the `eosio` account is the account creator doing the staking. Tokens staked during the initial token staking process cannot be unstaked and made liquid until after the minimum voting requirements have been met.
2. 0.45 token is staked for CPU, and 0.45 token is staked for network.
3. The next available tokens up to 9 total are held as liquid tokens.
4. Remaining tokens are staked 50/50 CPU and network.

```text
Example 1.  accountnum11 has 100 SYS. It will be staked as 0.1000 SYS on RAM; 45.4500 SYS on CPU; 45.4500 SYS on network; and 9.0000 SYS held for liquid use.

Example 2.  accountnum33 has 5 SYS. It will be staked as 0.1000 SYS on RAM; 0.4500 SYS on CPU; 0.4500 SYS on network; and 4.0000 SYS held for liquid use.
```

To make the tutorial more realistic, distribute the 1B tokens to the accounts using a Pareto distribution. The Pareto distribution models an 80-20 rule, e.g., in this case, 80% of the tokens are held by 20% of the population. The example here does not show how to generate the distribution, but focuses instead on the commands to do the staking. The script `bios-boot-tutorial.py` that accompanies this tutorial uses the Python NumPy (numpy) library to generate a Pareto distribution.

Use the following steps to stake tokens for each account. These steps must be done individually for each account.

[[note | Note]]
| _The key pair is created here for this tutorial. In a "live" scenario, the key value(s) and token share for an account should already be established through some well-defined out-of-band process._

```shell
cleos create key --to-console
```
```console
	Private key: 5K7EYY3j1YY14TSFVfqgtbWbrw3FA8BUUnSyFGgwHi8Uy61wU1o
	Public key: EOS8mUftJXepGzdQ2TaCduNuSPAfXJHf22uex4u41ab1EVv9EAhWt
```

```shell
cleos wallet import --private-key 5K7EYY3j1YY14TSFVfqgtbWbrw3FA8BUUnSyFGgwHi8Uy61wU1o
```
```console
imported private key for: EOS8mUftJXepGzdQ2TaCduNuSPAfXJHf22uex4u41ab1EVv9EAhWt
```

Create a staked account with initial resources and public key.

```shell
cleos system newaccount eosio --transfer accountnum11 EOS8mUftJXepGzdQ2TaCduNuSPAfXJHf22uex4u41ab1EVv9EAhWt --stake-net "100000000.0000 SYS" --stake-cpu "100000000.0000 SYS" --buy-ram-kbytes 8192
```
```console

```

### 2.5. Register the new account as a producer

To register the new account as a producer:

```shell
cleos system regproducer accountnum11 EOS8mUftJXepGzdQ2TaCduNuSPAfXJHf22uex4u41ab1EVv9EAhWt https://accountnum11.com EOS8mUftJXepGzdQ2TaCduNuSPAfXJHf22uex4u41ab1EVv9EAhWt
```

```

This makes the node a candidate to be a producer, but the node will not actually be a producer unless it is elected, that is, voted for.

### 2.6. List the producers

To facilitate the voting process, list the available producers. At this point, you will see only one account registered as a producer.

To list the producers:

```shell
cleos system listproducers
```
```console
Producer      Producer key                                           Url                                                         Scaled votes
accountnum11  EOS8mUftJXepGzdQ2TaCduNuSPAfXJHf22uex4u41ab1EVv9EAhWt  https://accountnum11.com/EOS8mUftJXepGzdQ2TaCduNuSPAfXJHf22 0.0000
```

### 2.7. Set up and start a new producer

Set up a new producer using the previously created `accountnum11` account. To set up the new producer, execute these steps to create a dedicated folder to hold the producer metadata:

```shell
cd ~/biosboot/
mkdir accountnum11
cd accountnum11
copy ~/biosboot/genesis/stop.sh
copy ~/biosboot/genesis/clean.sh
```

Create the following three shell script files and assign execution permission to them: `genesis_start.sh`, `start.sh`, `hard_start.sh`.

```shell
#!/bin/bash
DATADIR="./blockchain"
CURDIRNAME=${PWD##*/}

if [ ! -d $DATADIR ]; then
  mkdir -p $DATADIR;
fi

--hard-replay-blockchain \
>> $DATADIR"/nodeos.log" 2>&1 & \
echo $! > $DATADIR"/eosd.pid"
```

If you executed every step without an error, your folder structure should look like this:

```shell
cd ~/biosboot/accountnum11/
ls -al
```
```console
drwxr-xr-x   8 owner  group   256 Dec  7 14:17 .
drwxr-xr-x   3 owner  group   960 Dec  5 10:00 ..
-rwxr-xr-x   1 owner  group   40  Dec  5 13:08 clean.sh
-rwxr-xr-x   1 owner  group   947 Dec  5 14:31 genesis_start.sh
-rwxr-xr-x   1 owner  group   888 Dec  5 13:08 hard_start.sh
-rwxr-xr-x   1 owner  group   901 Dec  6 15:44 start.sh
-rwxr-xr-x   1 owner  group   281 Dec  5 13:08 stop.sh
```

Now you can start the second producer node by executing the following commands:

```shell
cd ~/biosboot/accountnum11/
./genesis_start.sh
tail -f blockchain/nodeos.log
```

After the above commands have executed, you should see in the command shell a live stream of `nodeos.log` file being written by the `nodeos` process continuously. You can stop the live stream monitor by pressing `[CTRL]+C`.

To stop the new node, you have to execute the `stop.sh` script and to restart the node, execute the `start.sh` script and not the `genesis_start.sh` (this one is used only once in *1.5 Start the genesis node*).

To erase everything and start from scratch, you can execute the following commands:

```shell
cd ~/biosboot/accountnum11/
./stop.sh
./clean.sh
./genesis_start.sh
tail -f blockchain/nodeos.log
```

### 2.8. Create multiple producers

Now you can repeat the process (from 2.4. to 2.7) to create as many producers as you want, each with its own staked account, own dedicated directory, named `accountnumXY` (with `X` and `Y` int values in interval [`1`..`5`]), and their own dedicated script files: `genesis_start.sh`, `start.sh`, `stop.sh`, `clean.sh` located in their corresponding folder.

Also, be careful how you mesh these nodes between each other, so pay particular attention to the following parameters in the `genesis_start.sh`, `start.sh`, and `hard_start.sh` scripts:

```shell
--producer-name $CURDIRNAME \ # Producer name, set in the script to be the parent directory name
...
--http-server-address 127.0.0.1:8011 \ # http listening port for API incoming requests
--p2p-listen-endpoint 127.0.0.1:9011 \ # p2p listening port for incoming connection requests
...
...
--p2p-peer-address localhost:9010 \   # Meshing with peer `genesis` node
--p2p-peer-address localhost:9012 \   # Meshing with peer `accountnum12` node
--p2p-peer-address localhost:9013 \.  # Meshing with peer `accountnum13` node
```

### 2.9. Vote for block producers

At this point, various nodes are launched, meshed together in a network, and they receive blocks from the genesis boot node. However, they do not produce yet.

**15% Requirement**

For the nodes to produce blocks, a total of 15% of the token supply must be staked and voted for all available producers.

We gave `accountnum11` enough tokens earlier. To elect block producers, execute the following command which allows one account to vote for up to 30 block producers by specifying their account name:

```shell
cleos system voteproducer prods accountnum11 accountnum11 accountnum12 accountnum13
```

## 3. Resign eosio account and system accounts

After producers are elected and the minimum number of requirements have been met, that is, a minimum 15% of tokens have been staked for votes, the `eosio` account can resign, and leave the `eosio.msig` account as the only privileged account.

To resign set the keys of the `eosio.*` accounts to `null`. Run the following command to clear the owner and active keys of the `eosio.*` accounts:

```shell
cleos push action eosio updateauth '{"account": "eosio", "permission": "owner", "parent": "", "auth": {"threshold": 1, "keys": [], "waits": [], "accounts": [{"weight": 1, "permission": {"actor": "eosio.prods", "permission": "active"}}]}}' -p eosio@owner
cleos push action eosio updateauth '{"account": "eosio", "permission": "active", "parent": "owner", "auth": {"threshold": 1, "keys": [], "waits": [], "accounts": [{"weight": 1, "permission": {"actor": "eosio.prods", "permission": "active"}}]}}' -p eosio@active
```

Also, the system accounts created in step [1.7. Create system accounts](#17-create-system-accounts) should be resigned as well by running the following commands:

```shell
cleos push action eosio updateauth '{"account": "eosio.bpay", "permission": "owner", "parent": "", "auth": {"threshold": 1, "keys": [], "waits": [], "accounts": [{"weight": 1, "permission": {"actor": "eosio", "permission": "active"}}]}}' -p eosio.bpay@owner

cleos push action eosio updateauth '{"account": "eosio.ram", "permission": "owner", "parent": "", "auth": {"threshold": 1, "keys": [], "waits": [], "accounts": [{"weight": 1, "permission": {"actor": "eosio", "permission": "active"}}]}}' -p eosio.ram@owner
cleos push action eosio updateauth '{"account": "eosio.ram", "permission": "active", "parent": "owner", "auth": {"threshold": 1, "keys": [], "waits": [], "accounts": [{"weight": 1, "permission": {"actor": "eosio", "permission": "active"}}]}}' -p eosio.ram@active

## 4. Monitor, test, monitor

You can monitor each `nodeos` process started, either the genesis node or any of the block producers nodes, by running the following commands:

```shell
cd ~/biosboot/genesis/
tail -f ./blockchain/nodeos.log
```

```shell
cd ~/biosboot/accountnum11/
tail -f ./blockchain/nodeos.log
```

You can test various commands, create accounts, check balance on accounts, transfer tokens between accounts, etc.

[[info | Accounts and Tokens]]
| - For commands on creating new accounts, see [How to create an account](/docs/40_node-operation/10_getting-started/10_local-development-setup/07_create-test-accounts.md) on the *Getting Started* section.
| - To issue, allocate, and transfer tokens between accounts, see the
[Deploy, Issue and Transfer Tokens](/docs/20_smart-contracts/30_tutorials/10_deploy-issue-and-transfer-tokens.md) tutorial on the *Smart Contracts* section.
