## Overview

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the computing environment native to the Ethereum Network.

The EVM support brings the following advantages:

* It connects the EOS and the Ethereum ecosystems.
* EOS can leverage well developed applications that already exist.
* The Solidity language and the numerous existing libraries can significantly increase the number of smart contract developers and applications on EOS.
* The Solidity developers and applications will benefit from the EOS EVM low gas cost, high performance, good finality, and time-tested stability of the EOS blockchain, in contrast with the other EVM-based chains.
* EOS EVM works with almost all wallets and development tools. Simply configure them to connect to the EOS EVM and you can start experiment with solidity smart contracts.
