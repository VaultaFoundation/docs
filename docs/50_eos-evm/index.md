title: EOS EVM
---

The EOS EVM is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) running on EOS which has been optimized for speed and scalability.

It is fully compatible with the Ethereum EVM, and supports all Ethereum smart contracts and applications,
but lowers the costs of interacting with them considerably. It also supports all Ethereum development tools and
libraries, such as Hardhat, Remix, ethers, and any other tools that are compatible with the Ethereum JSON-RPC API.

The EOS EVM is a drop-in replacement for the Ethereum EVM, and can be used to run any Ethereum application on EOS
with little to no changes.
