The EOS EVM Network Testnet Preview connection details follow:

* `Network Name`: EOS EVM Network Testnet
* `Chain ID`: 15556
* `New RPC URL`: https://api-testnet.eosnetwork.com/
* `Currency Symbol`: EVM
* `Block Explorer URL (Optional)`: https://explorer-testnet.eosnetwork.com/

Alternative endpoints can be found at [resources](30_resources.md) page.

Yet another way is to find the network you want to connect to at [Chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org/), and you can add the configuration to your wallet through that service.
