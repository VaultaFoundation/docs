title: Connect to EOS EVM Network

To try the Trust EVM:

* Connect to the network with your favorite wallet.
* Get some test tokens from the faucet and make some transfers.
* Set up IDEs to develop your smart contracts

Thanks to the high API compatibility of the Trust, most popular wallets and IDEs should work on Trust EVM seamlessly.

Necessary information to connect to the network can be found at [connect metamask](20_connect-metamask.md) and [resources](30_resources.md) documents.
