title: "Try EOS in DUNE"
---

If you do not want to install EOS binaries or have other types of installation restrictions, you can try EOS in [DUNE](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/DUNE) (Docker Utilities for Node Execution). This approach, powered by Docker, provides developers with a personal container for EOS blockchain management, smart contract development, and testing purposes.
