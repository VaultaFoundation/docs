title: DUNE Development Setup
---

If you do not want to install EOS binaries or have other types of installation restrictions, you can try EOS in [DUNE](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/DUNE) (Docker Utilities for Node Execution). This approach, powered by Docker, provides developers with a personal container for the EOS blockchain management, smart contract development, and testing purposes.

Install and set up EOS in DUNE (Docker Utilities for Node Execution):

- Prerequisites
- Before You Begin
- Install the Contract Dev. Toolkit
- Create Development Wallet
- Start keosd and nodeos
- Create Test Accounts
