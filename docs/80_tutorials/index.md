This section contains tutorials which guide you through a topic and explain what is happening and why. We have tutorials to show you:

## BIOS Boot Sequence

The [BIOS Boot Sequence](10_bios-boot-sequence.md) tutorial demonstrates how to boostrap a new EOSIO blockchain and explores the concepts used in creating a new blockchain. In the tutorial you will start a new blockchain, load the system contracts and then add multiple block producers.  

## Tic Tac Toe

In the tic-tac-toe tutorial you will build a smart contract that runs a tic tac toe game on the blockchain. The tutorial guides you step by step in writing the smart contract code, compiling and deploying the smart contract to the blockchain and then shows you how to use the smart contract. There are two versions of the tutorial:  
* [Tic-tac-toe using a local single node blockchain](20_tic-tac-toe-game-smart-contract-single-node.md)
* [Tic-tac-toe using the remote EOSIO Testnet.](21_tic-tac-toe-game-smart-contract-Testnet.md)  

## Understand EOSIO Token

The [EOSIO Token Tutorial](40_eosio_token.md) tutorial explores the *sample* EOSIO token smart contract and it helps you acquire the basic knowledge needed to build your own EOSIO token.

## Build Your Own EOSIO Token

The [Build Your Own EOSIO Token Tutorial](50_build_your_own_eosio_token.md) tutorial provides explanations and a step-by-step procedure to create and deploy an EOSIO blockchain token starting with the *sample* EOSIO token smart contract.

## Before you begin

To get started as quickly as possible we recommend using pre-built binaries. Building from source is a more advanced option but will set you back an hour or more and you may encounter build errors. See the [Getting Started Guide](../30_getting-started-guide) for details on how to install and set up the required EOSIO components.
