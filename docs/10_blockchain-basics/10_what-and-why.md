# What is decentralization

Decentralization is the process of distributing power away from a central authority or entity 
to a network of independent nodes. In the context of blockchain technology, decentralization 
refers to the absence of a central authority controlling the network. Instead, the network 
is maintained by a distributed network of nodes that work together to ensure the security 
and integrity of the network.

### Decentralization is a spectrum

Though the determination of something being centralized versus decentralized is binary,
the degree of decentralization is not. Decentralization is a spectrum, and the degree of
decentralization can be measured by the number of nodes in the network. The more nodes
in the network, the more decentralized it is. 

This does not mean that a network with more nodes is more secure than a network with fewer
nodes. In most decentralized networks nodes group together to form a "pool" of nodes that
work together to secure the network. In this case, the number of pools in the network is
a better measure of decentralization than the number of nodes.
