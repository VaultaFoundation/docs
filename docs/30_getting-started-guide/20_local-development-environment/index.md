Before you begin, check your [System Requirements](05_system_requirements.md).

The following list provides instructions to prepare your local development environment to build and deploy smart contracts:

1. [Install Antelope Binaries](10_installing-eosio-binaries.md): Steps to install Antelope pre-built binaries
2. [Install the CDT](20_installing-eosiocdt.md): Steps to install Antelope Contracts Development Kit (CDT) which will act as a compiler
3. [Create Development Wallet](30_development-wallet.md): Steps to create development wallet to store key pairs 
4. [Start Keosd and Nodeos](40_start-nodeos-keosd.md): Steps to start `Keosd` and `Nodeos` 
5. [Create Development Accounts](50_create-dev-accounts.md): Steps to create you first Antelope blockchain accounts for smart contracts
