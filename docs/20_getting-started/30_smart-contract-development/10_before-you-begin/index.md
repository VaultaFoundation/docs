This page outlines the prerequisites for building and deploying more complex smart contracts in EOSIO. Before getting into the advanced smart contracts development workflow, try the [Hello World Smart Contract](../../30_getting-started-guide/25_hello-world.md) in the _Getting Started Guide_ to understand the basic workflow of smart contracts development in EOSIO. 

To build smart contracts with different functionalities, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:
* [Run a Blockchain](10_running-a-blockchain.md)
* [Accounts and Permissions](20_accounts-and-permissions.md) 

Once you have understood these then look at the [Smart Contract Guide](../index.md) for details about smart contract development.
