Plugins extend the core functionality implemented in each tool. Plugins published by EOS Network Foundation are available in the standard binaries installation. 

There are currently two Antelope components which use plugins:

* [Nodeos Plugins.](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/v2.2/nodeos/plugins/index) - Plugins extend the core functionality implemented in [Nodeos](../../glossary/index#nodeos). Some plugins are mandatory, such as chain_plugin, net_plugin, and producer_plugin, which reflect the modular design of nodeos. The other plugins are optional as they provide nice to have features, but non-essential for the nodes operation. Follow this link [Nodeos Plugins](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/v2.2/nodeos/plugins/index) for more information.
* [Keosd Plugins.](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/v2.2/keosd/plugins/index) Plugins extend the core functionality implemented in [Keosd](../../glossary/index#keosd). Follow this link [Keosd Plugins](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/v2.2/keosd/plugins/index) for more information. 

## Community plugins

To use additional community plugins requires you to recompile the binaries linked to the appropriate plugin see [Community Plugin List](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/blob/master/plugins/COMMUNITY.md) for more information.
