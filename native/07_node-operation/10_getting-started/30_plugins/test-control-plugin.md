## Overview

The `test_control_plugin` is designed to facilitate internal tests of a `nodeos` instance. The current functionality allows a controlled and graceful `nodeos` shutdown when a specific block is reached within a sequence of blocks generated by a designated block producer. This is intended for testing, to determine exactly when a `nodeos` instance will shutdown.

> ℹ️ The `test_control_plugin` can be utilized to initiate a shutdown either based on the **head block**, which refers to the most recent block, or the **last irreversible block**, which represents the block that has achieved irreversible finality.

The `test_control_plugin` also implements the core functionality provided by the [Test Control API plugin](./test-control-api-plugin.md).
