    <title>Staking Contracts</title>
</head>

There are a few different contracts involved in Vaulta staking.

1. `eosio.system` - The system and staking contract.
2. `eosio.reward` - An intermediate reward dispersal contract.
3. `eosio.rex` - Account that holds all funds in the staking protocol.

> ℹ️ **Underlying tokens**
> Though Vaulta uses the VAULTA token, the staking system is legacy and uses EOS tokens in the rows for its data.

## eosio.system

The [system contract](https://unicove.com/account/eosio) is wider than just staking and controls the entire Vaulta network with 
capabilities like account creation, chain governance, and resource management.

The staking portions of the system contract are responsible for managing the staking
and unstaking of Vaulta tokens, as well as the distribution of rewards from the pre-allocated
staking rewards pool.

### Depositing Funds

In order to use Vaulta inside the staking portion of the system contract, you need to deposit them first. 

```cpp
void deposit( const name& owner, const asset& amount )
```

This will transfer your funds to the `eosio.rex` account and register them as deposited into the staking protocol.
This will **not** stake them for you yet though, they are simply held within the protocol.

> **Parameters**   
> The parameter `owner` is the account that is depositing the funds.

### Staking Deposited Funds

Once you have deposited funds into the staking protocol, you can stake them to receive rewards.

```cpp
void buyrex( const name& from, const asset& amount )
```

This will stake the funds that you have deposited into the staking protocol and issue you REX tokens in return.


### Staking Funds From Voting Rights

You can have your Vaulta staked as voting rights. You may also use those funds as a source for staking.

```cpp
void unstaketorex( const name& owner, const name& receiver, const asset& from_net, const asset& from_cpu )
```

This will move your voting rights staked funds into rewards staked funds, and issue you REX tokens in return.
You will still retain your voting rights.

> **Note**   
> All staked funds within the staking protocol have voting rights attached to them.


### Unstaking Funds

```cpp
void mvfrsavings( const name& owner, const asset& rex )
```

This will move funds out of eternally locked "savings" account and begin the 21 day unstaking period. Any funds you 
move out of that savings account within the same day will be attributed to the same unstaking bucket and mature within
the same 21-day period.

### Withdrawing Funds

Once the 21-day unstaking/maturation period has finished, you can sell your position and withdraw your funds.
You will need to do this in two steps.

```cpp
void sellrex( const name& from, const asset& rex )
```

This action will convert your REX tokens back into Vaulta and register them as available to withdraw.

```cpp
void withdraw( const name& owner, const asset& amount )
```

This action will withdraw your Vaulta tokens from the staking protocol and transfer them to your account.


> **Note**   
> Any action you take within the staking protocol once a 21-day unstaking period has finished will trigger an 
> automatic `sellrex` on your fully matured REX tokens. This will convert them back into Vaulta and register them as 
> available to withdraw.

### Tables

The system contract has a few tables that are relevant to staking.

#### rexbal

[The `rexbal` table](https://unicove.com/contract/eosio/tables/rexbal) holds information about staked balances for users.

- `version`
- `owner`
- `vote_stake`
- `rex_balance` - the amount of REX owned
- `matured_rex` - matured REX available for selling
- `rex_maturities` - An array of maturity dates and amounts

#### rexfund

[The `rexfund` table](https://unicove.com/contract/eosio/tables/rexfund)
holds information about the deposited but unstaked EOS funds for users. 

- `version`
- `owner`
- `balance` - the amount of EOS deposited

#### rexmaturity

[The `rexmaturity` table](https://unicove.com/contract/eosio/tables/rexmaturity)
holds information about the maturity dates of REX tokens for users.

- `num_of_maturity_buckets` - The number of days until a position fully matures
- `sell_matured_rex` - A flag that indicates if to sell matured positions on any action
- `buy_rex_to_savings` - A flag that indicates if staked funds go directly to savings or not

#### rexpool

[The `rexpool` table](https://unicove.com/contract/eosio/tables/rexpool)
holds information about the staking pool.

- `version`
- `total_lent` - total amount of EOS in open rex_loans
- `total_unlent` - total amount of EOS available to be lent (connector)
- `total_rent` - fees received in exchange for lent (connector)
- `total_lendable` - total amount of EOS that have been lent (total_unlent + total_lent)
- `total_rex` - total number of REX shares allocated to contributors to total_lendable
- `namebid_proceeds` the amount of EOS to be transferred from namebids to REX pool
- `loan_num` increments with each new loan

This is useful if you want to calculate the price of EOS vs REX. 

```typescript
static convertEosToRex(eos:number){
    const pool = get(rexpool);
    if(!pool) return 0;
    const S0 = parseFloat(pool.total_lendable.split(' ')[0]);
    const S1 = S0 + eos;
    const R0 = parseFloat(pool.total_rex.split(' ')[0]);
    const R1 = (S1 * R0) / S0;
    return parseFloat(parseFloat((R1 - R0).toString()).toFixed(4));
}

static convertRexToEos(rex:number){
    const pool = get(rexpool);
    if(!pool) return 0;
    const S0 = parseFloat(pool.total_lendable.split(' ')[0]);
    const R0 = parseFloat(pool.total_rex.split(' ')[0]);
    const R1 = R0 + rex;
    const S1 = (S0 * R1) / R0;
    return parseFloat(parseFloat((S1 - S0).toString()).toFixed(4));
}
```

#### rexretpool

[The `rexretpool` table](https://unicove.com/contract/eosio/tables/rexretpool)
holds information about the return pool for REX tokens.

- `version`
- `last_dist_time` - the last time proceeds from renting, ram fees, and name bids were added to the rex pool
- `pending_bucket_time` - timestamp of the pending 12-hour return bucket
- `oldest_bucket_time` - cached timestamp of the oldest 12-hour return bucket
- `pending_bucket_proceeds` proceeds in the pending 12-hour return bucket,
- `current_rate_of_increase` the current rate per dist_interval at which proceeds are added to the rex pool,
- `proceeds` the maximum amount of proceeds that can be added to the rex pool at any given time

## eosio.reward

The [reward contract](https://unicove.com/contract/eosio.reward) ([see contract code](https://github.com/vaultafoundation/eosio.reward)) is an intermediate contract 
that is responsible for dispersing the rewards from the staking rewards tokenomics bucket to the various strategies 
aimed at rewarding the Vaulta community.

It allows the Vaulta blockchain to define a [set of receivers](https://unicove.com/contract/eosio.reward/tables/strategies) 
that will receive rewards, and a weight for each receiver.

See the [inflows](./inflows) document for more information on how the reward contract is funded.

> **Note**   
> Modifying strategies is controlled by the block producers and requires a 15/21 multisig to change.

### Adding or Updating Strategies

```cpp
void setstrategy( const name strategy, const uint16_t weight )
```

This action will set or update a strategy with a given weight. The weight is a percentage of the total rewards that
will be allocated to this strategy. For instance, if there are three strategies with weights of 1000, 2000, and 7000, 
then the first strategy will receive 10% of the rewards, the second 20%, and the third 70%.

### Removing Strategies

```cpp
void delstrategy( const name strategy )
```

This will remove any strategy from the reward contract.



### Distributing Rewards

```cpp
void distribute()
```

Funds that have flowed into this contract since the last distribution will be distributed to the strategies based on their
weights. It is better to call this at a higher interval to make sure that any small amounts of funds are not lost to 
rounding errors.

> **Note**   
> Any account can call this action.



## eosio.rex

The [contract on the eosio.rex account](https://github.com/vaultafoundation/system-contracts/blob/8ecd1ac6d312085279cafc9c1a5ade6affc886da/contracts/eosio.system/src/rex.results.cpp#L1) is merely a record-keeping contract. Each of the actions
does nothing (no implmentation) and is only there to provide an identifiable record within the transactions stack that
can be tracked and filtered by external tooling such as history solutions or frontend SDKs that want more 
information that normally would not be available (like the REX received for an amount of EOS in a `buyrex` action).

```cpp
void buyresult( const asset& rex_received ) { }
void sellresult( const asset& proceeds ) { }
void orderresult( const name& owner, const asset& proceeds ) { }
void rentresult( const asset& rented_tokens ) { }
```

As different actions trigger results on the `eosio.rex` account, it will add one of these identifiable records to the 
transaction stack based on the calling action. For instance, if you call `buyrex`, you will see a `buyresult` record.
