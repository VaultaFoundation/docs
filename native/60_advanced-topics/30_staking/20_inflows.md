### Rewards

[In May of 2024 the EOS network underwent a tokenomics change](https://eosnetwork.com/blog/eos-network-approves-tokenomics-proposal-ushering-in-a-new-era-for-eos/) that introduced a new bucket
of EOS tokens designated for staking rewards.

250,000,000 EOS was set aside in this bucket to be emitted with a halving schedule every 4 years. Meaning that in
the first 4 years 125,000,000 EOS will be distributed as staking rewards (31,250,000 EOS per year), and in the next 4 years
62,500,000 EOS will be distributed as staking rewards (15,625,000 EOS per year), and so on.

Inflation for the chain was also shut off during that change, and the various buckets replaced that inflated EOS.
This means that instead of inflating the chain at a set rate of X% per year, the chain now distributes a percentage of the
pre-allocated buckets to various parts of the network, like staking rewards.
