EOS Staking is a system-level contract that allows users to stake their EOS tokens to
receive rewards from the network.

## Lockup periods

When you stake your EOS tokens you lock them up for a certain period of time.

The minimum lockup period is 21 days, but that period could be longer depending on when
you as the user decide to unstake your tokens, as the lockup period only starts when you unstake.

Otherwise, the lockup period is indefinite.

## Accounting token

When you stake your EOS tokens you get a token called REX in return.
REX is a non-transferable token that represents the amount of value you have staked.
The conversion rate between EOS and REX is dynamic and goes up as more staking rewards are 
distributed into the rewards pool. 

The value of REX never decreases, only increases.

## Rewards

The rewards from staking originate from a pre-allocated bucket of EOS tokens that are
designated for staking rewards and aimed at incentivizing users to stake their tokens, 
growing and securing the network.
