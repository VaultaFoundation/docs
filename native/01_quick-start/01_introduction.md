Vaulta is one of the most performant blockchains in the world.
It is capable of processing 10,000+ transactions per second, with minimal fees and near-instant confirmation times. 

Before you begin, you should have a basic understanding of blockchain technology and Vaulta.
If you are new to blockchain, check out our [Core Concepts](/docs/02_core-concepts/10_blockchain-basics/10_decentralization.md) section
which dives into the knowledge you need to get off on the right foot.

## Start coding immediately

**We recommend trying things out in the [Web IDE](https://ide.vaulta.com/)** before you start developing locally.

But once you're ready to develop locally, you can use this CLI to create a new project with a frontend and contracts.
```bash
npm create vaulta@latest myproject
```

Follow the prompts, and it will set up either a [Template Project](https://github.com/vaultafoundation/template-projects)
or a barebones project with a simple contract, tests, and deployment scripts as well as a frontend of your choosing (SvelteKit, Next.js (react), or Nuxt (vue)).

Check out the next section to get started with your first smart contract.
